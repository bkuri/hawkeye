  "readme": "# node-inotify - monitoring file system events in Gnu/Linux with [NodeJS][nodejs_home]\nThe inotify API provides a mechanism for monitoring file system events.\nInotify can be used to monitor individual files, or to monitor directories.\nWhen a directory is monitored, inotify will return events for the directory\nitself, and for files inside the directory. [(ref: GNU/Linux Manual)][inotify.7]\n\n## Installation\n[NodeJS][nodejs_dev] versions 0.8.x are currently supported and tested.\n\n### Install from NPM (Easy way)\n    $ npm install inotify\n\n### Install from git\n    $ npm install node-gyp -g\n    $ git clone git://github.com/c4milo/node-inotify.git\n    $ cd node-inotify\n    $ node-gyp rebuild\n\n## API\n  * `var inotify = new Inotify()`: Create a new instance of Inotify. By default it's in persistent mode.\n  You can specify `false` in `var inotify = new Inotify(false)` to use the non persistent mode.\n\n  * `var wd = inotify.addWatch(arg)`:  Add a watch for files or directories. This will then return a watch descriptor. The argument is an object as follows\n        var arg = { path: 'path to be monitored',\n                    watch_for: an optional OR'ed set of events to watch for.\n                               If they're not specified, it will use\n                               Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS by default,\n                    callback: Callback function that will receive each event.\n        }\nYou can call this function as many times as you want to monitor different paths.\n**Inotify monitoring of directories is not recursive**: to monitor subdirectories\nunder a directory, additional watches must be created.\n\n  * `inotify.removeWatch(watch_descriptor)`: Remove a watch associated with the watch_descriptor param and returns `true` if the action was succesful or `false` in the opposite case. Removing a watch cause an `Inotify.IN_IGNORED` event to be generated for this watch descriptor.\n\n  * `inotify.close()`: Remove all the watches and close the inotify's file descriptor. Returns `true` if the action was succesful or false in the opposite case.\n\n### Event object structure\n```javascript\n    var event = {   watch: Watch descriptor,\n                    mask: Mask of events,\n                    cookie: Cookie that permits to associate events,\n                    name: Optional name of the object being watched\n                };\n```\n\nThe `event.name` property is only present when an event is returned for a file inside a\nwatched directory; it identifies the file pathname relative to the watched\ndirectory.\n\n\n## Example of use\n\n```javascript\n    var Inotify = require('inotify').Inotify;\n    var inotify = new Inotify(); //persistent by default, new Inotify(false) //no persistent\n\n    var data = {}; //used to correlate two events\n\n    var callback = function(event) {\n        var mask = event.mask;\n        var type = mask & Inotify.IN_ISDIR ? 'directory ' : 'file ';\n        event.name ? type += ' ' + event.name + ' ': ' ';\n\n        //the porpuse of this hell of 'if'\n        //statements is only illustrative.\n\n        if(mask & Inotify.IN_ACCESS) {\n            console.log(type + 'was accessed ');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MODIFY) {\n            console.log(type + 'was modified ');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_OPEN) {\n            console.log(type + 'was opened ');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE) {\n            console.log(type + ' opened for reading was closed ');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CLOSE_WRITE) {\n            console.log(type + ' opened for writing was closed ');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_ATTRIB) {\n            console.log(type + 'metadata changed ');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_CREATE) {\n            console.log(type + 'created');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_DELETE) {\n            console.log(type + 'deleted');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_DELETE_SELF) {\n            console.log(type + 'watched deleted ');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVE_SELF) {\n            console.log(type + 'watched moved');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_IGNORED) {\n            console.log(type + 'watch was removed');\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVED_FROM) {\n            data = event;\n            data.type = type;\n        } else if(mask & Inotify.IN_MOVED_TO) {\n            if( Object.keys(data).length &&\n                data.cookie === event.cookie) {\n                console.log(type + ' moved to ' + data.type);\n                data = {};\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    var home_dir = { path:      '/home/camilo', // <--- change this for a valid directory in your machine.\n                     watch_for: Inotify.IN_OPEN | Inotify.IN_CLOSE,\n                     callback:  callback\n                  };\n\n    var home_watch_descriptor = inotify.addWatch(home_dir);\n\n    var home2_dir = { path:      '/home/bob', // <--- change this for a valid directory in your machine\n                      watch_for: Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS,\n                      callback:  callback\n                  };\n\n    var home2_wd = inotify.addWatch(home2_dir);\n\n```\n\n## Inotify Events\n\n### Watch for:\n * **Inotify.IN_ACCESS:** File was accessed (read)\n * **Inotify.IN_ATTRIB:** Metadata changed, e.g., permissions, timestamps, extended attributes, link count (since Linux 2.6.25), UID, GID, etc.\n * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE_WRITE:** File opened for writing was closed\n * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE:** File not opened for writing was closed\n * **Inotify.IN_CREATE:** File/directory created in the watched directory\n * **Inotify.IN_DELETE:** File/directory deleted from the watched directory\n * **Inotify.IN_DELETE_SELF:** Watched file/directory was deleted\n * **Inotify.IN_MODIFY:** File was modified\n * **Inotify.IN_MOVE_SELF:** Watched file/directory was moved\n * **Inotify.IN_MOVED_FROM:** File moved out of the watched directory\n * **Inotify.IN_MOVED_TO:** File moved into watched directory\n * **Inotify.IN_OPEN:** File was opened\n * **Inotify.IN_ALL_EVENTS:** Watch for all kind of events\n * **Inotify.IN_CLOSE:**  (IN_CLOSE_WRITE | IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE)  Close\n * **Inotify.IN_MOVE:**  (IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO)  Moves\n\n### Additional Flags:\n * **Inotify.IN_ONLYDIR:** Only watch the path if it is a directory.\n * **Inotify.IN_DONT_FOLLOW:** Do not follow symbolics links\n * **Inotify.IN_ONESHOT:** Only send events once\n * **Inotify.IN_MASK_ADD:** Add (OR) events to watch mask for this pathname if it already exists (instead of replacing the mask).\n\n### The following bits may be set in the `event.mask` property returned in the callback\n * **Inotify.IN_IGNORED:** Watch was removed explicitly with inotify.removeWatch(watch_descriptor) or automatically (the file was deleted, or the file system was unmounted)\n * **Inotify.IN_ISDIR:** Subject of this event is a directory\n * **Inotify.IN_Q_OVERFLOW:** Event queue overflowed (wd is -1 for this event)\n * **Inotify.IN_UNMOUNT:** File system containing the watched object was unmounted\n\n\n\n## License\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright 2012 Camilo Aguilar.
